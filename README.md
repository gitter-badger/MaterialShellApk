MaterialShellApk
================

Material Design based shell app for Android.

The app leverages Google's new Material Design Guidelines and provides bootstrapper for creating new apps based on the Material Design Paradigms.

I am planning to add menu items, basic items in the nav drawer, hamburger menu in the near future. (I am a beginner Android Developer). If you know how to do that, please go ahead, I would be hapy to merge PRs.

Feel free to contribute.
